# Reversal

Have you ever wanted to play a game of DDR on your laptop? Now you can, with *Reversal*.

I created this app using the NERD stack, which took advantage of React's modular structure. I took advantage of the modularity of React and created redux store on the front end to preserve constantly changing game state.

My stretch goals for this project is to build a live multiplayer game that allows users to challenge each other with extra features such as power ups.
